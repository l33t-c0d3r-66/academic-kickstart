I am a final year student at <a href="https://bits-pilani.ac.in/">BITS Pilani, Goa</a> where I'm majoring in Math and Electronics. I work in the field of Cryptography. I am extremely interested in working on theoretical aspects of Cryptography and to address the gap between practices and theory in this field, especially in the areas of secure computation, zero-knowledge proofs and provable security of fundamental cryptographic primitives. Recently, I have gained interest in developing and analysing cryptographic approaches to come up with better privacy preserving techniques for data science, in particular Machine Learning. I also love to work on bringing these modern cryptographic primitives to practice.

I'm currently writing my senior thesis at <a href="https://uclouvain.be/">Universit√© catholique de Louvain</a> supervised by <a href="https://perso.uclouvain.be/fstandae/">Prof. Francois-Xavier Standaert</a>. Recently, I interned with the <a href = "https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view_group.php?id=7284">Blockchain and Smart Contracts group</a> at <a href ="https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view_group.php?id=8069">IBM Research, India</a> under <a href ="https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=in-dvinaya1">Dr. Dhinakaran Vinayagamurthy</a>. I am also working with <a href="https://www.eng.biu.ac.il/hazay/">Prof. Carmit Hazay</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/muthuv/">Prof. Muthu Venkitasubramaniam</a> to come up with efficient methods for generating RSA modulus in a distributed setting.

Feel free to check out my <a href = "https://rahulbs98.github.io/files/cv.pdf">CV</a> and drop me an <a href="mailto:rahulbs1798@gmail.com">e-mail</a> if you want to chat with me!
