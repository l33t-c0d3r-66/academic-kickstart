I am a fourth year student from BITS Pilani, pursuing a double major in Math and Electronics. I am extremely interested in working on theoretical aspects of Cryptography and to address the gap between practices and theory in the field of Cryptography, especially in the problems of secure computation, zero-knowledge proofs and provable security in fundamental cryptographic primitives.
