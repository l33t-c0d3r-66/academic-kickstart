**Work:**
- Designed a modular framework for Interactive Zero Knowledge Protocols which was used to convert it to a non-interactive protocol.
- Implemented additional features for the design to support oracles, protocol composition, etc.. and tested existing protocols like Ligero on it

**An abstraction of the implementation:**
